Subarray -> Contiguous part of array
Eg: 1207202 -> subarry -> 207, 202
Possible max subarray -> n(n+1)/2

Subsequence -> May not be contiguous but order is maintained
Eg: 1207202 -> subsequence -> 272, 12
Possible max subsequence -> 2^n

Every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray
